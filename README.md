# Data-Analytics-Project

WELCOME TO MY SPACE!

This is my data analytics project for the black distruptor data analysis bootcamp. In this project, using SQL, Tableau, Excel and Python, I explored, analysed and created visualisations on a healthcare dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO).
I looked at the general trend of life expectancy over the years. I then focused on the effect of country 'status' i.e. whether it is developing or already developed. I highlighted the top 10 and bottom 10 countries with the highest life expectancy.
