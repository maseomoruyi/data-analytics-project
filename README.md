# Data-Analytics-Project

This is my data analytics project. In this project, I explored a healthcare dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO). The dataset focuses on immunisation factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. This is based on different countries so these factors can be used to predict life expectancy. This can help a country look at areas in which it can improve the life expectancy of its population.
