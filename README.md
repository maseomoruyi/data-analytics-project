# Data-Analytics-Project

WELCOME TO MY SPACE!

This is my data analytics project for the black distruptor data analysis bootcamp. In this project, using SQL, Tableau, Excel and Python, I explored, analysed and created visualisations on a healthcare dataset from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

ENJOY!
